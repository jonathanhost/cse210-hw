Explain the meaning of Abstraction
Highlight a benefit of Abstraction
Provide an application of Abstraction
Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote
Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)

The obstraction is the way by the OOP to hide information that is not necessary to the user, like a way to provide just the 'front' to the user and not the backend behind the code.The benefit of the abstraction is to turn easier to the user use the code and make complexy scripts without needs to make attention to all object functions and code. An exemple of obstration is yoour television, you can turn on and wach your movies and channels, but is not necessary for you know how the television is working inside, just to know how use it.
The exemple of code is:
Television mytv = new Television(); // Create a Television object
mytv.turnOn; // Call the abstract method
myPig.turnOff();
